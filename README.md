# DevOps Oxford

DevOps Oxford is a Meetup Group on DevOps topics based in Oxford, UK. You can follow our events on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/devopsoxford/). 

We are using this GitHub repository to find speakers for future events and to interact with our audience in order to propose and vote on topics for upcoming events. 

## How to submit a talk 

Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/devopsoxford/devopsoxford/issues) and create a new issue. Please provide the following:

- Title of your talk
- Brief description of your talk
- Brief bio or something about yourself (including social links if you wish)

We are open to both technical and non-technical topics that have something to do with DevOps. It's fine to talk about specific tools and technologies but please don't make it a vendor pitch. To get inspired, have a look at our [past events](https://www.meetup.com/devopsoxford/events/past/).    

## How to propose and vote on a topic

Is there a DevOps topic you would like to know more about? Maybe how to solve a DevOps problem you encountered in your daily work? Or what's all that hype about a specific technology? We want to hear from you! Open a new issues on the [Issues page](https://github.com/devopsoxford/devopsoxford/issues) or vote on an existing open issue using `:+1:` (:+1:).
